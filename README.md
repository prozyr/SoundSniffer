# Sound Sniffer

Sound Sniffer is a mobile application for analyzing the acoustic environment of the user, enabling the detection of sounds from the surroundings and presenting them on charts.

## Project Objective

The project aims to create a mobile application that allows users to monitor sound levels and analyze the characteristics of sound in real-time.

## Project Scope

- The application is written in Java for the Android platform.
- It enables the detection of sounds from the device's microphone and presents them on charts.
- Features include starting and stopping sound detection and detecting a selected frequency based on amplitude.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Compile and run the application on your Android device.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you can:
- Start and stop sound detection.
- Select an interesting frequency by marking it on the amplitude histogram.
- Analyze changes in the frequency of sound over time using the spectrogram.

## Technical Challenges

During the development of the application, the following technical challenges may arise:
- Aliasing: the phenomenon of the inability to reconstruct the signal based on samples.
- Noise: signal disturbances related to background noise.
- Delays: heavy data operations on mobile devices may lead to delays in application performance.
